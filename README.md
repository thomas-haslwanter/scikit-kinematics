IMUs
====

Analysis of signals from IMUs (intertial-measurement-units). Read in
data, calculate orientation (with one of the algorithms below)

-   get\_data ... This method must be taken from one of the existing
    sensors, or from your own sensor. Currenlty the following sensors
    types are available:
    -   XSens
    -   xio (XIO, NGIMU, and XIO3)
    -   yei

    \* polulu
-   calc\_position

MARG Systems
------------

-   imus.analytical ... Calculate orientation and position, from angular
    velocity and linear acceleration
-   imus.kalman ... Calculate orientation from IMU-data using an
    Extended Kalman Filter.
-   

    imus.IMU ... Class for working with data from IMUs

    :   -   imus.IMU.calc\_position ... calculate position
        -   imus.IMU.setData ... set the properties of an IMU-object
        -   imus.IMU.set\_qtype ... sets q\_type, and automatically
            performs the relevant calculations.

-   imus.Madgwick ... Class for calculating the 3D orientation with the
    Madgwick-algorithm
-   imus.Mahony ... Class for calculating the 3D orientation with the
    Mahony-algorithm

Markers
=======

    video-basedrecordings of 3D markers
-   markers.find\_trajectory ... Calculation of joint-movements from 3D
    marker positions

Quaternions
===========

Note that all these functions work with single quaternions and
quaternion vectors, as well as with arrays containing these.

Quaternion class
----------------

-   

    quat.Quaternion ... class, including overloading for multiplication and

    :   division (e.g. "quatCombined = quat1 \* quat2"), import and
        export

--------------------------------------

-   quat.q\_conj ... Conjugate quaternion
-   quat.q\_inv ... Quaternion inversion
-   quat.q\_mult ... Quaternion multiplication
-   quat.q\_scalar ... Extract the scalar part from a quaternion
-   quat.q\_vector ... Extract the vector part from a quaternion
-   quat.unit\_q ... Extend a quaternion vector to a unit quaternion.

Conversion routines - quaternions
--------------------------------=

-   quat.calc\_angvel ... Calculates the velocity in space from
    quaternions
-   quat.calc\_quat ... Calculate orientation from a starting
    orientation and angular velocity.
-   quat.convert ... Convert quaternion to corresponding rotation matrix
    or Gibbs vector
-   quat.deg2quat ... Convert number or axis angles to quaternion
    vectors
